				My name is Tölgyesi Gergely Márk, a self-claimed rocket scientist, space enthusiast, possible future aerospace engineer. I was born on 30th of oktober 2001, and as everybody in the hungarian system, i went to primary school at the age of 6. At the age of 12 i swithced my school and attened at the Prohászka Ottokár Chatolic High School in Budakeszi. This school was the booster, that i needed to ba able to enroll the Pannonhalmi Bencés High School in Pannonhalma. This high-school is one of the most elite and most rewarding school to study at in Hungary, moreover I established several foreign connections due to the shool-given possibilities. I started in 2016, and during highschool I passed my B2 language exam, and earned my driving license as well. Since 12 i was obsessed by rockets, more specifcally rocket engines, so a attended science lessons in my last years( mainly mathematical sciences and phisics). I completed the Hungarian érettségi exams with an excellent grade, and enrolled at the Budapesti Mérnőki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem , Machanical engeneering faculty. I still intend to be a competitive aerospace engineer, but aside of this, my hobbies includes racing cars ( mostly F1), history, and arts. I think it's really important for a person to have a ballanced personality in terms of field of interest. I think, my personality enables me to achive even higher levels of complex understanding of aerospace topics, but also serves az a good foundation for a mentally balanced, and satisfying life. My motto's meaning is simple. Dare to have big dreams, because big achievments came from big dreams.
